# Character Sheet Generator

This is intended as learning project. Firstly we aimed to learn [React](https://reactjs.org/) and then we decided to take [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) road. React created application is in branch [main-react](https://github.com/haterzlin/character-sheet/tree/main-react).

Current version of application can be viewed at [https://lubomir.mlich.cz/quest/branches/main/].

Purpose of this project is to enable to create [VTM5](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Vampire:_The_Masquerade_5th_Edition) character sheet and export it to JSON file for further use or print.

In future we can try to use different than VTM5 model and try to use exported JSON file in some other webapp.
